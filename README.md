# CV_template
CV template en LaTeX version en français.
LaTeX CV template in englsih version.
The original version is from a friend of mine. I have updated the template to work with babel[french].
I still have an issue with the title and the è, é, à, ç, and french symbol. 
To make it work in this version, use XeLaTex, but the output is not as fancy as the englsih version.
