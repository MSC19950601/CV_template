# CV_template <br />
CV template en LaTeX version en français. <br />
LaTeX CV template in englsih version. <br />
The original version is from a friend of mine. I have updated the template to work with babel[french]. <br />
I still have an issue with the title and the è, é, à, ç, and french symbol.  <br />
To make it work in this version, use XeLaTex, but the output is not as fancy as the englsih version. <br />
